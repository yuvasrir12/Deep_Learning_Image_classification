# Deep_Learning_Image_classification
To develop an approach for accurate prediction of leaf disease and select the most suitable  deep learning models for optimal performance.

4 Models namely-

1)MobileNet

2)VGG16

3)VGG19

4)ResNet50

The best working model among these four are : VGG16. VGG16 is further fine-tuned by Parameter Tweaking.

These Models are applied on 3 different datasets namely-

data source1: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset]
tomato and potato dataset is taken from here


data source2: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rizwan123456789/potato-disease-leaf-datasetpld]
potato dataset is taken from here
